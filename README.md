## Diamond-Square implementation

Before the implementation of the algorithm, a flat square grid consisting of vertices is generated with sides consisting of 2^n+1 vertices. In our case, we decided that an n=8 value generated the most suitable terrain.

The Diamond-Square algorithm was then implemented using recursion. Each iteration of the recursion consisted of one or more square and diamond steps. It is worth noting that on a diamond/square step, the width and heights of the corner points were always relative to the current iteration of the algorithm.

</p>

As seen above, if we started with a 4x4 grid, the first iteration would start with a diamond step that used the initial corner points, forming a square with dimension 4. On the second iteration, there would then be multiple diamond steps each with corner points that formed a square with dimension 2. As we can see, each iteration would half the dimension. Using this property, we half the dimension in each recursive step until we reach the base case of dimension = 1.


```c#
void RecursiveDSquare (int dim, float heightDiff) {
        // base case of lowest granularity step
        if (dim == 1) {
            return;
        }

        // perform diamond step on respective vertices
        for (int z = 0; z < size - 1; z += dim) {
            for (int x = 0; x < size - 1; x += dim) {
                int centre = (int) ((z * size + x) + (dim * 0.5 * size + dim * 0.5));
                DiamondStep (centre, dim, heightDiff);
            }
        }

        .
        .
        .
        
    }
```

## Camera Motion

You can use images/gif by adding them to a folder in your repo:

To create a gif from a video you can follow this [link](https://ezgif.com/video-to-gif/ezgif-6-55f4b3b086d4.mov).

## Wave generation

The wave uses a custom shader that uses the Phong illumination model. The wave motion is created by the shader, by adding a displacement value to the height of a flat plane with respect to its x, z, and Time values.

### Phong Illumination

## Sun Implementation

The sun rotation is implemented by a simple Z rotation script. By nesting the sphere and directional light in an empty game object, the sphere was set to a specfic distance relative to the parent game object. Rotating the parent object would thus rotate the sun and the direction of the light around the terrain.
