## Diamond-Square implementation

Before the implementation of the algorithm, a flat square grid consisting of vertices is generated with sides consisting of 2^n+1 vertices. In our case, we decided that an n=8 value generated the most suitable terrain. Our diamond square algorithm will go on to alter the height of these vertices in the grid. These vertices are stored in a 1D array and the 2D position of the vertices will be calculated throughout the algorithm to improve efficiency.

The Diamond-Square algorithm was implemented using recursion. Each iteration of the recursion consisted of one or more square and diamond steps. It is worth noting that on a diamond/square step, the width and heights of the corner points were always relative to the current iteration of the algorithm.

</p>

As seen above, if we started with a 4x4 grid, the first iteration would start with a diamond step that used the initial corner points, forming a square with dimension 4. On the second iteration, there would then be multiple diamond steps each with corner points that formed a square with dimension 2. As we can see, each iteration would half the dimension. Using this property, we half the dimension in each recursive step until we reach the base case of dimension = 1.


```c#
void RecursiveDSquare (int dim, float heightDiff) {
        // base case of lowest granularity step
        if (dim == 1) {
            return;
        }

        // perform diamond step on respective vertices
        for (int z = 0; z < size - 1; z += dim) {
            for (int x = 0; x < size - 1; x += dim) {
                int centre = (int) ((z * size + x) + (dim * 0.5 * size + dim * 0.5));
                DiamondStep (centre, dim, heightDiff);
            }
        }
        .
        . // square steps
        .
```

The DiamondStep function takes in the index of our "centre" vertice, and using the current dimension "dim" (which is recursively reduced as previously mentioned), calculate the index of the four corners. This is then used to find an average of the four corners and a random proportion of heightDiff is set as the new centre vertice height. As we can see in our RecursiveDSquare function, we perform the diamond step across every "dim" vertices in both the x and z axis. For example, on the second iteration of a 4x4 grid, the following red vertices would have the DiamondStep function called upon them.

</p>


Following this, we go on to perform square steps. The SquareStep function is very similar to the DiamondStep function, except that the corners used are in the shape of a diamond instead. In addition, if the SquareStep is performed on a vertice that sits on the edge of the grid (hence only having access to 3 corner points), the average of the available 3 corner points is used instead.

```c#
        // perform square step on alternating rows
        for (int z = (int) (dim * 0.5); z < size; z += dim) {
            for (int x = 0; x < size; x += dim) {
                SquareStep (z * size + x, dim, heightDiff);
            }
        }

        // perform square step on other alternating rows
        for (int z = 0; z < size; z += dim) {
            for (int x = (int) (dim * 0.5); x < size; x += dim) {
                SquareStep (z * size + x, dim, heightDiff);
            }
        }
        .
        .
        .
```
From above, we perform the square steps every alternating "dim" rows, as better explained in the following diagram:

<p align="center">
  <img src="Images/Square-Step-Diagram.png"  width="300" >
</p>

In essence, both for loops iterate through the same order of vertices, just at different starting points. This is easier to implement as we can see in each for loop, the vertices being altered all occur on the same column.

```c#
        // reduce random height being added
        float newHeightDiff = (float) (heightDiff * heightDepreciation);

        RecursiveDSquare ((int) (dim * 0.5), newHeightDiff);
    }
```
Finally, we multiply the heightDiff by a constant betwen 0-1, resulting in smaller and smaller random height being added to the vertices on each iteration as per the typical Diamond Square Algorithm steps. We can also see how we are halving the "dim" value being used for the next iteration.

## Vertex Shaders

### Phong Illumination

Both the terrain and water uses the Phong illumination model for its custom shaders. The Phong illumination is made of 3 components: Ambient, Diffuse, and Specular. The specular component has been omitted for the terrain as a realistic terrain does not look shiny. The attenuation factor is set to a constant of 1 as the light source used in the project is a directional light. 

## Wave generation

The wave uses a custom shader that uses the Phong illumination model. The wave motion is created by the shader, by adding a displacement value to the height of a flat plane with respect to its x, z, and Time values. Using a sin function, this creates a a wave motion resembling a sin wave. Rather than using the built-in Plane 3D object in Unity, a custom Plane object was created so that it would contain more vertices/triagles for the wave motion to look smoother.

## Sun Implementation

The sun rotation is implemented by a simple Z rotation script. By nesting the sphere and directional light in an empty game object, the sphere was set to a specfic distance relative to the parent game object. Rotating the parent object would thus rotate the sun and the direction of the light around the terrain.
