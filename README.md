Remember that _"this document"_ should be `well written` and formatted **appropriately**. It should be easily readable within Github. Modify this file...
this is just an example of different formating tools available for you. For help with the format you can find a guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github).

## Technologies

Project is created with:

- Unity 2019.4.3f1
- Ipsum version: 2.33
- Ament library version: 999

## Diamond-Square implementation

The Diamond-Square algorithm was implemented using recursion. 

You can include a code snippet here, but make sure to explain it!
Do not just copy all your code, only explain the important parts.

```c#
public class meshGenerator : MonoBehaviour
{
    //This function run once when Unity is in Play
     void Start ()
    {
      GenerateMesh();
    }

    void GenerateMesh()
    {
      .
      .
      .
    }
}
```

## Camera Motion

You can use images/gif by adding them to a folder in your repo:

</p>

To create a gif from a video you can follow this [link](https://ezgif.com/video-to-gif/ezgif-6-55f4b3b086d4.mov).

## Wave generation

The wave uses a custom shader that uses the Phong illumination model. The wave motion is created by the shader, by adding a displacement value to the height of a flat plane with respect to its x, z, and Time values.

## Vertex Shaders

### Phong Illumination

## Sun Implementation

The sun rotation is implemented by a simple Z rotation script. By nesting the sphere and directional light in an empty game object, the sphere was set to a specfic distance relative to the parent game object. Rotating the parent object would thus rotate the sun and the direction of the light around the terrain.
